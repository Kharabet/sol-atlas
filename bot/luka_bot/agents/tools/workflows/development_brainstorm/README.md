# Product Development Brainstorm

Structured three-step dialog workflow that helps a founder articulate a product challenge, generate solution ideas, and design a validation experiment.

## Flow Overview

1. **Clarify the Challenge** – capture target users, pain point, and desired outcome.
2. **Generate Solution Ideas** – brainstorm several options with pros/cons framed around the problem.
3. **Prioritize and Plan** – select one idea, define a lightweight validation experiment, and agree on the next step plus success metric.

Use this workflow when the user wants help exploring product directions or planning the next experiment. It works well during early discovery conversations or periodic strategic checkpoints.
