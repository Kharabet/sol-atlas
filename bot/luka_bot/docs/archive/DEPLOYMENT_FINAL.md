## 🎯 What's New

### Critical Improvements ✅
1. **Moderation V2** - 5-7x faster responses (<1s instead of 5-7s)

- ✅ `/moderation` command for admins
- ✅ `/reputation` command for users
- ✅ `/groups` command with KB/agent info

- ✅ **V2 architecture** (non-blocking background moderation)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Stop Current Bot
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where bot is running
```

### 2. Restart Bot
```bash
/Users/evgenyvakhteev/Documents/src/dexguru/bot/venv/bin/python \
/Users/evgenyvakhteev/Documents/src/dexguru/bot/luka_bot/__main__.py
```

### 3. Verify Startup
Look for these logs:
```
✅ Bot: GURU Keeper (@GuruKeeperBot, ID: ...)
✅ ModerationService singleton created
✅ ReplyTrackerService initialized  # NEW in V2
✅ luka_bot started successfully
```

### 4. Quick Test
```
# In a group where bot is present:
@GuruKeeperBot hello

# Expected:
# - Reply within <1 second ✅
# - No 5-second delay ✅
# - Logs show [V2] markers ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Core Features (Must Test)
- [ ] **Mentions** - Bot responds in <1 second
- [ ] **Language** - Switch language, LLM responds in new language
- [ ] **Groups** - `/groups` shows all groups with KB info
- [ ] **Moderation** - Toggle button changes status

### V2 Moderation (Must Test)
- [ ] **Fast responses** - <1 second even with moderation enabled
- [ ] **Background logs** - See `[V2]` and `[Background]` markers
- [ ] **Reply tracking** - See `📍 Tracked bot reply` logs
- [ ] **Retroactive delete** - Violating message + bot reply both deleted

### Optional (Nice to Test)
- [ ] **Reputation** - `/reputation` shows points
- [ ] **Achievements** - Unlock achievement, see announcement
- [ ] **Reset** - `/reset` clears group data, requires confirmation
- [ ] **Admin menu** - Admins get controls when bot added to group

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### V2 Response Time
| Scenario | Expected Time | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Mention (no mod) | <1 second | Same as before |
| Mention (with mod) | <1 second | **NEW: Was 5-7s in V1!** ✅ |
| Violation deletion | 1-10 seconds | Background, retroactive |

### V2 Log Markers
```
# When message arrives:
🛡️ [V2] Firing background moderation
🔥 [V2] Moderation task fired, continuing immediately

# Bot replies immediately (no waiting!)
✅ Sent LLM response to group
📍 [V2] Tracked bot reply 12345

# Meanwhile, in background:
🛡️ [Background] Starting moderation for message 12344
🛡️ [Background] Moderation result: delete - spam
🚫 [Background] Deleting violating message
🗑️ [Background] Deleted user message 12344
🗑️ [Background] Also deleted bot reply 12345
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Moderation Status
**Default**: ❌ **Disabled** (for best performance)

**Recommendation**: Keep disabled until you've tested V2 thoroughly

**To Enable**: 
1. In group, find welcome message
2. As admin, click "🛡️❌ Moderation" button
3. Changes to "🛡️✅ Moderation"
4. Bot now evaluates messages in background

### V2 vs. V1
| Feature | V1 (Old) | V2 (New) |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Response time | 5-7s | <1s ✅ |
| Blocking | Yes ❌ | No ✅ |
| Can delete bot reply | No ❌ | Yes ✅ |
| Scalability | Poor ❌ | Excellent ✅ |

### Known Limitations
1. ⚠️ **LLM still slow** - Moderation LLM call takes >5s (under investigation)
2. ⚠️ **Brief visibility** - Violations visible for 1-10s before deletion (acceptable)
3. ⚠️ **Redis overhead** - Extra ops for reply tracking (negligible)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot Still Slow (5+ seconds)
**Check**: Are you using V2?
```bash
# Look for these in logs:
[V2] Firing background moderation  # Should see this
[Background] Starting moderation   # Should see this

# Should NOT see:
⏱️ Background moderation timed out  # Old V1 code
```

**Fix**: Restart bot if you see V1 markers

### Moderation Not Working
**Check**: Is moderation enabled?
```
Look at welcome message in group
Button should show: 🛡️✅ Moderation
If shows: 🛡️❌ Moderation - it's disabled
```

**Fix**: Click button to enable

### Messages Not Deleted
**Check**: Background task logs
```bash
# Should see:
[Background] Starting moderation
[Background] Moderation result: delete
[Background] Deleted user message
```

**Fix**: Check LLMService is working, moderation prompt is correct

### Bot Replies Not Deleted
**Check**: Reply tracking logs
```bash
# Should see:
📍 [V2] Tracked bot reply 12345
[Background] Also deleted bot reply 12345
```

**Fix**: Verify ReplyTrackerService initialized

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### What to Watch
1. **Response time** - Should be <1 second
2. **Background task count** - Should not accumulate
3. **Redis memory** - Reply tracking uses minimal memory
4. **Error logs** - Background errors don't crash bot

### Success Metrics
- ⚡ 95%+ of responses in <1 second
- 🛡️ 90%+ of violations detected
- ❌ <1% false positives
- 🚫 <5% of deletions fail

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If V2 has issues:

### Step 1: Disable Moderation
```
In all groups:
Click "🛡️✅ Moderation" button
Changes to "🛡️❌ Moderation"
```

### Step 2: Monitor
```
Check logs for errors
Verify bot responses still fast
Test core features (mentions, /groups)
```

### Step 3: Report Issues
```
1. Save error logs
2. Note which feature failed
3. Test in isolation
4. Fix and redeploy
```
