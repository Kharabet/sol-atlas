# Luka Bot Documentation Index

This directory hosts the refreshed documentation for the Luka Bot component of the SOL Atlas ecosystem. Start with the overview to understand the product surface, then dive into architecture, setup, and operating practices. Historical design notes remain available under `archive/` for reference.

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](overview.md) – product positioning, personas, and core capabilities.
- [Architecture](architecture.md) – service layout, message flow, and external dependencies.
- [Setup & Configuration](setup.md) – local development, environment variables, and Docker targets.
- [Operations Guide](operations.md) – deployment profiles, observability, security, and runbooks.
- [Development Workflow](development.md) – coding standards, testing strategy, and localization tips.

## Legacy Material
All pre-2025 design journals, milestone reports, and experiment logs are preserved in [`archive/`](archive/). They are not required to run the current system but remain helpful when tracking historical decisions.
