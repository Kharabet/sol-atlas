# Group /reset Command - Feature Documentation

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**  
**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Scope:** Admin-only group command

## 📋 Overview

Implemented `/reset` command for Telegram groups that allows administrators to reset all bot data for their group. The command includes proper safety mechanisms to prevent accidental data loss.

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Admin-Only Access
- Only group administrators can use the command
- Regular members see access denied message
- Verification at both command and confirmation levels

### ✅ Safety Confirmation
- Two-step confirmation process
- Detailed warning about what will be deleted
- Shows group name and KB index
- Large red warning text
- Only the requesting admin can confirm

### ✅ What Gets Reset
- ❌ **ALL group links COMPLETELY DELETED** (for all users in the group)
- ❌ Group configuration cleared from Redis
- ❌ **Elasticsearch knowledge base DELETED** (all indexed messages)
- 💡 Bot will auto-reinitialize (with welcome messages) when mentioned again

## 🎨 User Experience

### Step 1: Admin types `/reset` in group

```
⚠️ WARNING: Reset Group Data

Group: Axioma-GURU
KB Index: tg-kb-group-1002493387211

This will:
• ❌ Delete all indexed messages
• ❌ Clear group knowledge base
• ❌ Remove group configuration
• ❌ Reset all group settings

This action CANNOT be undone!

Are you sure you want to reset all bot data for this group?

[⚠️ Yes, Reset Everything]
[❌ Cancel]
```

### Step 2: Admin clicks confirmation

```
✅ Group Data Reset Complete

• 3 group link(s) deleted
• Configuration cleared
• Knowledge base deleted

💡 The bot will reinitialize if you send a new message or add it again.
```

### If Cancelled:

```
✅ Reset Cancelled

No changes were made to the group.
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Admin Verification**
   - Checks admin status when command is issued
   - Re-checks admin status on confirmation
   - Prevents privilege escalation

2. **User Verification**
   - Only the admin who requested can confirm
   - Other users can't confirm someone else's reset
   - Prevents accidental confirms by other admins

3. **Data Safety**
   - Group links COMPLETELY DELETED for all users (hard-delete in Redis)
   - **Elasticsearch KB index permanently deleted**
   - Clear warnings about irreversibility
   - Proper error handling if ES deletion fails

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `luka_bot/keyboards/default_commands.py` - Added to admin commands
2. `luka_bot/handlers/group_commands.py` - Implementation

### Code Structure:

```python
@router.message(Command("reset"))
async def handle_reset_in_group(message: Message):
    # 1. Check admin status
    # 2. Get group KB info
    # 3. Show confirmation dialog
    
@router.callback_query("group_reset_confirm:")
async def handle_reset_confirmation(callback: CallbackQuery):
    # 1. Verify requesting user
    # 2. Re-check admin status
    # 3. Get all users in group
    # 4. Delete ALL group links (complete removal)
    # 5. Delete Elasticsearch KB index
    # 6. Show success message with deleted count
    
@router.callback_query("group_reset_cancel")
async def handle_reset_cancel(callback: CallbackQuery):
    # Show cancellation message
```

### Data Flow:

```
Admin types /reset
    ↓
Check admin status
    ↓
Check if group has data
    ↓
Show confirmation dialog
    ↓
Admin clicks button
    ↓
Verify user & admin status
    ↓
Get all users in group
    ↓
Delete ALL group links
    ↓
Delete Elasticsearch KB index
    ↓
Show success message
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Should Work:
- [x] Admin types `/reset` → sees confirmation
- [x] Admin clicks "Yes" → group reset
- [x] Admin clicks "Cancel" → cancelled message
- [x] Group with no data → "No data to reset" message

### ❌ Should Fail Gracefully:
- [x] Non-admin types `/reset` → access denied
- [x] Different admin clicks confirm → "Only requester can confirm"
- [x] Non-admin clicks confirm → access denied

## 📊 Command Visibility

| User Type | Can See `/reset`? | Can Execute? |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Regular member | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Group admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Bot owner (DM) | ❌ No | ❌ No |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (✅ COMPLETE):
- ✅ Elasticsearch KB index deletion implemented
- ✅ Error handling for ES failures
- ✅ Success/failure feedback to admin

### Phase 2 (Potential):
- Option to export data before reset
- Option to reset only KB, not config
- Option to reset only config, not KB
- Scheduled resets (auto-cleanup inactive groups)
- Reset history log for auditing

## 📝 Logging

All actions are logged:
