# Daily Reflection & Planning

Mindful evening routine that helps users celebrate wins, capture lessons, and set focused intentions for tomorrow.

## Flow Overview

1. **Celebrate Wins** – surface positive moments or achievements from today.
2. **Capture Lessons** – discuss challenges, insights, and adjustments worth remembering.
3. **Set Intentions for Tomorrow** – choose up to three priorities, a guiding intention, and a concrete next action.

This workflow works well for end-of-day journaling, lightweight retrospectives, or preparing for tomorrow’s stand-up.
