# Ollama Streaming Fix - October 12, 2025

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Discovery**: Ollama uses **cumulative streaming** (like OpenAI), not delta streaming!

### The Code Change
In `/luka_bot/services/llm_service.py` (line 321):

**Before**:
```python
is_cumulative_streaming = (actual_provider == "openai")  # ❌ Treated Ollama as delta
```

**After**:
```python
is_cumulative_streaming = True  # ✅ Both providers use cumulative
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
✅ Response complete: 8897 chars
✅ Streaming complete: 8897 chars
🔍 Response preview: Text...Text...Text...  ← Duplication!
```

User saw: Message building up with repeated text like "Quick ways...Quick ways...Quick ways..."

### After Fix (Expected)
```
✅ Response complete: XXXX chars
✅ Streaming complete: XXXX chars
🔍 Response preview: Correct text  ← No duplication!
```

User will see: Clean streaming with full response, no duplication.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Keep Ollama as primary provider** in `config.py`:
   ```python
   AVAILABLE_PROVIDERS: dict = {
       "ollama": ["gpt-oss", "llama3.2"],  # Primary
       "openai": ["gpt-5", "gpt-4-turbo"], # Fallback
   }
   ```

2. **Restart the bot**

3. **Send a long question** in DM (e.g., "How to get to Belgrade?")

4. **Check for**:
   - ✅ Char counts match: `Response complete` == `Streaming complete`
   - ✅ No text duplication in the message
   - ✅ Full response displayed
   - ✅ Clean streaming (no repeated text building up)

5. **Look for this log**:
   ```
   🔄 Streaming mode: cumulative (both providers) [actual_provider=ollama, ...]
   ```

## 📝 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Log shows: `🔄 Streaming mode: cumulative (both providers)`
- Message streams cleanly without duplication
- Final message is complete and correct
- Char counts match in logs

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Text duplication still present
- Char counts mismatch
- Message incomplete or garbled
- Any error messages

## 🔍 Why This Happened

1. We **assumed** Ollama used delta streaming (each chunk = only new text)
2. We **implemented** `full_response += chunk` for Ollama
3. Ollama **actually** uses cumulative streaming (each chunk = full response so far)
4. Result: "Hello" + "Hello world" = "HelloHello world" ❌

The fix applies **delta extraction** to both providers:
```python
delta = chunk[len(full_response):]  # Extract only new text
full_response = chunk  # Update to latest full response
yield delta  # Yield only the delta
```
