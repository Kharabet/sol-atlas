# Session Update: Admin Menu Moderation Focus

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Fixed `GroupLink.group_title` References
Fixed 3 handlers that were trying to access removed `GroupLink.group_title` attribute:
- ✅ `group_settings_inline.py` - Settings menu
- ✅ `group_admin.py` - Admin menu back button
- ✅ `start.py` - Deep link handling

**Solution**: All now retrieve `group_title` from `Thread` model with Telegram API fallback.

---

### 2. Restructured Admin Menu (DM)

#### ❌ Removed:
- ⚙️ **Group Settings** (redundant with inline)
- 🔗 **Manage Threads** (not implemented)
- 🔍 **Search Group KB** (use `/search` instead)

#### ✅ Added:
- 🛡️ **Moderation Settings** - Full moderation config hub
- 🚫 **Configure Stoplist** - Banned words management
- 🗑️ **System Messages Filter** - Auto-delete system messages

---

## New Features

2. See current banned words (e.g., "spam, scam, ...")
3. Click "Edit Stoplist" → bot prompts for words
4. Reply: spam, scam, phishing
5. Bot confirms with preview
6. Words immediately active for moderation
```

**Features**:
- ✅ FSM-based conversation flow
- ✅ Comma-separated word list
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Admin-only access

- ✅ Clear stoplist button

### 🛡️ Moderation Hub

**Sub-menus** (existing from previous work):

- 🏆 Reputation (points, achievements)
- 🔔 Notifications (alerts, announcements)

### 🗑️ System Message Filter

**Planned Types** (UI ready, logic coming soon):
- 👤 User joined/left

- 📌 Pinned messages
- 🎉 Group created

Currently: All service messages detected by existing moderation system.

## Interactive Features Added

### FSM-based Stoplist Editor

**Flow**:
1. Click "✏️ Edit Stoplist" button
2. Bot message changes to prompt:
   ```
   ✏️ Edit Stoplist
   
   Please send me the words you want in the stoplist.
   
   Format: word1, word2, word3
   
   Example: spam, scam, phishing, porn, drugs
   
   Separate words with commas. Send /cancel to abort.
   ```
3. User replies: `spam, scam, phishing, porn`
4. Bot responds:
   ```
   ✅ Stoplist updated!
   
   Total words: 4
   Preview: spam, scam, phishing, porn
   
   Messages containing these words will be 
   automatically deleted.
   ```

**FSM States**:
- `StoplistEditForm.waiting_for_words` - Waiting for user input
- `StoplistEditForm.group_id` - Stores group ID during conversation

**Validation**:
- ✅ Checks admin status
- ✅ FSM state management
- ✅ Sanitizes word list (trim, lowercase)
- ✅ Rejects empty lists
- ✅ Session expiry handling
- ✅ `/cancel` command support

- Changes persist across bot restarts
- TTL managed by moderation service

### FSM Storage
- aiogram's built-in FSM for conversation state
- Stores group_id during stoplist edit
- Automatic cleanup after completion/cancel

### Admin Controls
- All handlers verify admin status
- Consistent permission model
- Graceful error handling

---

## Testing

### Basic Flow ✅
1. Admin accesses admin menu (from group or `/groups`)
2. Sees new admin menu
3. Clicks "Configure Stoplist"
4. Clicks "Edit Stoplist"
5. Bot prompts for words
6. Admin replies with comma-separated words
7. Verifies confirmation
8. Posts message in group with stoplist word
9. Verifies auto-deletion

### Edge Cases ✅
- Non-admin attempts (rejected at edit)
- FSM session expiry (graceful error)
- Empty word list (retry prompt)
- `/cancel` during edit (FSM cleared)
- Only commas/spaces (rejected)
