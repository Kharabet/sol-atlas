# Ollama Cumulative Streaming Discovery - October 12, 2025

## 🔍 Discovery

**Critical finding**: Ollama uses **cumulative streaming**, not delta streaming!

### Initial Assumption (WRONG)
We assumed:
- OpenAI: Cumulative (each chunk = full response so far)
- Ollama: Delta (each chunk = only new text)

### Reality (CORRECT)
**Both providers use cumulative streaming!**
- OpenAI: Cumulative ✅
- Ollama: **ALSO Cumulative** ✅

## 🐛 The Bug

### What Happened
With `is_cumulative_streaming = (actual_provider == "openai")`, Ollama was treated as delta mode:

```python
else:
    # Ollama mode: delta text, accumulate directly
    full_response += chunk  # ❌ WRONG for cumulative chunks!
    yield chunk
```

### Result
When accumulating cumulative chunks:
- Chunk 1: "Hello" → full_response = "Hello"
- Chunk 2: "Hello world" → full_response = "Hello" + "Hello world" = "HelloHello world" ❌
- Chunk 3: "Hello world!" → full_response = "HelloHello world" + "Hello world!" = "HelloHello worldHello world!" ❌

This caused **massive text duplication** as seen in the user's screenshot.

### Evidence from Logs
```
✅ Response complete: 8897 chars
✅ Streaming complete: 8897 chars  ← Counts match (accumulation working)
🔍 Response preview: Same text...Same text...Same text...  ← DUPLICATION!
```

The response contained the same text repeated multiple times, confirming cumulative chunks were being accumulated.

## ✅ The Fix

### Code Change
In `/luka_bot/services/llm_service.py` (lines 319-322):

**Before**:
```python
is_cumulative_streaming = (actual_provider == "openai")
logger.info(f"🔄 Streaming mode: {'cumulative (OpenAI)' if is_cumulative_streaming else 'delta (Ollama)'} [actual_provider={actual_provider}, ctx_provider={ctx.llm_provider}]")
```

**After**:
```python
# IMPORTANT: Both OpenAI and Ollama use cumulative streaming
# (each chunk contains the full response so far, not just new text)
is_cumulative_streaming = True  # Always use delta extraction
logger.info(f"🔄 Streaming mode: cumulative (both providers) [actual_provider={actual_provider}, ctx_provider={ctx.llm_provider}]")
```

### How Delta Extraction Works
For cumulative chunks, we extract only the delta (new text):

```python
if chunk.startswith(full_response):
    delta = chunk[len(full_response):]  # Extract only new text
    if delta:
        full_response = chunk  # Update to latest full response
        yield delta  # Yield only the delta
```

**Example**:
- Chunk 1: "Hello" → delta = "Hello" (full_response was "")
- Chunk 2: "Hello world" → delta = " world" (new text only)
- Chunk 3: "Hello world!" → delta = "!" (new text only)

Result: "Hello world!" (correct, no duplication) ✅

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix (Ollama)
```
✅ Response complete: 8897 chars
✅ Streaming complete: 8897 chars
🔍 Response preview: Text...Text...Text...  ← Duplication!
```

User saw: Repeated text building up as message streamed.

### After Fix (Ollama)
```
✅ Response complete: XXXX chars
✅ Streaming complete: XXXX chars
🔍 Response preview: Correct text  ← No duplication!
```

User will see: Clean streaming with no duplication, just like OpenAI.

## 🧪 Testing Required

1. **Test with Ollama** (primary):
   - Restart bot
   - Send a long question
   - Verify no text duplication
   - Verify full response displayed

2. **Re-test with OpenAI** (regression test):
   - Change provider order
   - Restart bot
   - Send a long question
   - Verify still works correctly

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Never assume streaming behavior** - Always test and verify
2. **Provider documentation can be misleading** - Actual behavior may differ
3. **Test with multiple providers** - Each may have quirks
4. **Logs are essential** - Response preview helped identify duplication
5. **Delta extraction is universal** - Works for any cumulative streaming provider
