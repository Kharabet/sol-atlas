# 🎉 Phase 3: Thread Management - COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for testing  
**Time:** ~1 hour implementation

---

## What We Built

### Thread Model ✅

**File:** `models/thread.py` (75 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Thread data model with Redis serialization
- ✅ Auto-timestamping (created_at, updated_at)
- ✅ Message count tracking
- ✅ Placeholder for Camunda integration (Phase 4)
- ✅ to_dict() / from_dict() for Redis storage

### Thread Service ✅

**File:** `services/thread_service.py` (240 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ Create threads (auto-named or custom)
- ✅ List threads (sorted by activity)
- ✅ Get/update/delete threads
- ✅ Active thread management per user
- ✅ Rename threads
- ✅ Thread ownership validation
- ✅ Redis-based persistence (30-day TTL)

**Key Methods:**
- `create_thread()` - Create new thread
- `list_threads()` - List all user threads
- `get_active_thread()` - Get current thread
- `set_active_thread()` - Switch threads
- `rename_thread()` - Update thread name
- `delete_thread()` - Remove thread

### /chats Handler ✅

**File:** `handlers/chats.py` (220 lines)

**Features:**
- ✅ List all threads with inline keyboard
- ✅ Create new thread button
- ✅ Thread selection/switching
- ✅ Refresh thread list
- ✅ Current thread indicator (▶️)
- ✅ Message count display
- ✅ Clean inline UI

**Commands:**
- `/chats` - Open thread management UI

**Callbacks:**
- `thread_create` - Create new thread
- `thread_select:{id}` - Switch to thread
- `thread_refresh` - Refresh list

### Updated Components ✅

**`services/llm_service.py`**
- Added thread_id parameter to stream_response()
- Thread-scoped history (key: `thread_history:{thread_id}`)
- Backward compatible with user-scoped history

**`handlers/streaming_dm.py`**
- Auto-creates first thread ("Main Chat")
- Uses active thread for context
- Updates thread activity after each message
- Thread-scoped conversation history

**`handlers/__init__.py`**
- Added chats router
- Updated phase comments

**`handlers/start.py`**
- Updated welcome message for Phase 3

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
User Message
     ↓
streaming_dm.py
     ↓
[Get/Create Active Thread]
     ↓
thread_service.py
     ↓
llm_service.py (with thread_id)
     ↓
[Load thread history from Redis]
     ↓
Ollama API
     ↓
[Stream response]
     ↓
[Save to thread history]
     ↓
[Update thread activity]
```

### Thread Storage (Redis)

**Thread Data:**
```
Key: thread:{thread_id}
Type: Hash
TTL: 30 days

Fields:
- thread_id
- user_id
- name
- created_at
- updated_at
- message_count
- is_active
- process_instance_id (Phase 4)
```

**User Index:**
```
Key: user_threads:{user_id}
Type: Set
Values: [thread_id1, thread_id2, ...]
```

**Active Thread:**
```
Key: user_active_thread:{user_id}
Type: String
Value: thread_id
```

**Thread History:**
```
Key: thread_history:{thread_id}
Type: List
TTL: 7 days
Values: [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, ...]
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Flow 1: Auto-Thread Creation

```bash
# 1. Start bot
python -m luka_bot

# 2. In Telegram (fresh user):
Hi!
# → Should auto-create "Main Chat" thread
# → Response in that thread

# 3. Send another message:
Tell me more
# → Should use same thread
# → History preserved
```

### Test Flow 2: Manual Thread Management

```bash
# 1. Open thread list:
/chats
# → Should show "Main Chat" with message count

# 2. Create new thread:
[Tap "➕ Create New Thread"]
# → Creates "Chat 2"
# → Switches to it

# 3. Chat in new thread:
What's the weather?
# → Response in new thread
# → No history from Chat 1

# 4. Switch back:
/chats
[Tap "▶️ Main Chat (2)"]
# → Switches to Main Chat
# → History preserved
```

### Test Flow 3: Multiple Threads

```bash
# 1. Create 3 threads via /chats
# 2. Chat in each one with different topics
# 3. Verify history isolation:
   - Thread 1: Python questions
   - Thread 2: Weather chat
   - Thread 3: General conversation
# 4. Switch between threads
# 5. Verify each maintains its own context
```

### Expected Behavior

**Thread Creation:**
- Auto-creates "Main Chat" on first message
- Manual creates "Chat N" (N = count + 1)
- Sets as active immediately

**Thread Switching:**
- Updates active thread
- Loads correct history
- Shows confirmation message

**History Isolation:**
- Each thread has separate history
- No context bleeding between threads
- History persists across switches

## Configuration

### Redis Keys Added

```
# Thread data
thread:{thread_id}              # Thread metadata (hash)
user_threads:{user_id}          # Thread IDs set
user_active_thread:{user_id}    # Current thread (string)
thread_history:{thread_id}      # Conversation (list)

# Legacy (Phase 2 compat)
llm_history:{user_id}           # User-scoped history
```

### TTLs

- Thread data: 30 days
- Thread history: 7 days (inherited from Phase 2)

---

## What's Different from Phase 2

| Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|---------|---------|
| Single conversation per user | Multiple threads per user |
| User-scoped history | Thread-scoped history |
| No thread management | /chats command |
| Manual history only | Thread metadata tracking |
| No context switching | Seamless thread switching |

---

## Features Demo

### Thread List UI

```
📚 Your Threads

You have 3 thread(s).

Select a thread to switch to it, or create a new one! 👇

[▶️ Main Chat (5)]
[Chat 2 (2)]
[Chat 3 (0)]
[➕ Create New Thread]
[🔄 Refresh]
```

### Thread Switch Confirmation

```
🔀 Switched to Thread

Chat 2
Messages: 2
Created: 2025-10-04 08:45

Send a message to continue the conversation!
```

### Auto-Creation Log

```
💬 Streaming message from user 922705: hello...
✨ Auto-created first thread for user 922705
🧠 LLM request: user=922705, model=gpt-oss, history=0 msgs
✅ Streaming complete: 25 chars
💾 Updated thread activity
```

## Known Limitations

### Phase 3 Scope

**What We Don't Have Yet:**
- ❌ Thread renaming UI (service exists, no handler yet)
- ❌ Thread deletion UI (service exists, no handler yet)
- ❌ Camunda integration (Phase 4)
- ❌ Thread control messages (Phase 2 spec)
- ❌ Divider messages on switch (Phase 2 spec)

**Why?**
- Focus on core thread functionality first
- UI enhancements in future iteration
- Keeping Phase 3 simple and testable

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Testing

1. Test auto-thread creation
2. Test manual thread creation
3. Test thread switching
4. Test history isolation
5. Verify thread persistence

### Phase 4: Camunda Integration

**Goal:** Workflow-driven dialogs with process automation

**Implementation:**
1. Copy Camunda client from bot_server
2. Link threads to process instances
3. Implement task fetching
4. Add workflow execution
5. Task-based UI elements

**Estimate:** 3-4 hours, ~500 lines

---

## Performance

### Benchmarks (Expected)

- **Thread creation:** < 50ms
- **Thread listing:** < 100ms (10 threads)
- **Thread switching:** < 30ms
- **Redis ops per message:** 4 (get active, get thread, update thread, save history)
- **Memory:** ~50MB + thread data (~1KB per thread)

### Monitoring

**New Logs:**
```
✨ Created thread {id} for user {user_id}: {name}
✨ Auto-created first thread for user {user_id}
🔀 Set active thread for user {user_id}: {thread_id}
📚 Listed {count} threads for user {user_id}
💾 Updated thread {thread_id}
🗑️  Deleted thread {thread_id}
```

Hello!              # Auto-creates thread
/chats              # See thread list
[Create thread]     # Make new thread
What is Python?     # Chat in new thread
