# Thread Divider Implementation

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Implemented organic thread dividers that appear when users switch between threads or start new ones, showing thread context and last message preview.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Divider Service (`services/divider_service.py`)

**Core Functions:**

**`create_thread_divider(thread_id, user_id, divider_type)`**
- Creates formatted divider with thread info
- Shows thread name, message count, last active time
- Displays last message preview for context
- Three types: "switch", "new", "continue"

**`get_last_message_preview(thread_id, max_length)`**
- Fetches last message from thread history
- Truncates to 80 characters
- Shows role (You: / Bot:)

**`send_thread_divider(user_id, thread_id, divider_type, bot)`**
- Sends divider message to user
- Handles bot instance

**`send_simple_divider(user_id, text, bot)`**
- Sends simple text divider
- Used for generic separations

## 🔧 Integration Points

### 1. Thread Selection via Reply Keyboard
**File:** `handlers/keyboard_actions.py`  
**Function:** `handle_thread_selection()`

**Before:**
```python
await message.answer(
    f"🔀 Switched to Thread\n\n{thread.name}\n...",
    reply_markup=keyboard
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Send divider with context
await send_thread_divider(user_id, thread_id, divider_type="switch", bot=message.bot)

# Update keyboard
keyboard = await get_threads_keyboard(threads, thread_id)
await message.answer("📋", reply_markup=keyboard)
```

**User Experience:**
1. User taps thread name in reply keyboard
2. Divider appears showing thread info + last message
3. Keyboard updates with active indicator
4. User knows exactly where they are and what was last said

---

### 2. New Thread Button (➕ New Thread)
**File:** `handlers/keyboard_actions.py`  
**Function:** `handle_new_thread_button()`

**Before:**
```python
response = "✨ Starting New Conversation\n\n{prompt}"
await message.answer(response, reply_markup=keyboard)
```

**After:**
```python
# Send simple divider
await send_simple_divider(
    user_id,
    "✨ <b>Starting New Thread</b>",
    bot=message.bot
)

# Then show prompt
response = "💭 What would you like to discuss?\n\n{prompt}"
await message.answer(response, reply_markup=keyboard)
```

**User Experience:**
1. User taps "➕ New Thread"
2. Divider separates from previous context
3. Welcome prompt appears
4. Clear visual break in conversation

---

### 3. Lazy Thread Creation (First Message)
**File:** `handlers/streaming_dm.py`  
**Function:** `handle_streaming_message()`

**Before:**
```python
thread = await thread_service.create_thread(user_id, thread_name)
await message.answer(f"✨ Started: {thread_name}", reply_markup=keyboard)
```

**After:**
```python
thread = await thread_service.create_thread(user_id, thread_name)

# Send divider for new thread
await send_thread_divider(user_id, thread_id, divider_type="new", bot=message.bot)

# Update keyboard
keyboard = await get_threads_keyboard(threads, thread_id)
await message.answer("📋", reply_markup=keyboard)
```

**User Experience:**
1. User types first message
2. Thread created with LLM-generated name
3. Divider shows new thread started
4. LLM response follows naturally

## 📊 Technical Details

### Divider Format

```python
divider = f"""━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{icon} <b>{action}: {thread.name}</b>
💬 <i>{message_count} messages • Last: {time_ago}</i>

<i>{last_message_preview}</i>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"""
```

### Icons by Type
- `🔀` - Switch (switching to existing thread)
- `✨` - New (creating new thread)
- `📝` - Continue (continuing in thread)

### Time Display
- < 1 min: "just now"
- < 1 hour: "X min ago"
- < 24 hours: "X hour(s) ago"
- ≥ 24 hours: "X day(s) ago"

### Last Message Preview
- Fetches from `thread_history:{thread_id}` Redis list
- Shows last user or bot message
- Truncated to 80 characters
- Format: "You: ..." or "Bot: ..."

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Switch between existing threads → divider shows with last message
- [ ] Tap "➕ New Thread" → divider appears before prompt
- [ ] Type first message in new thread → divider shows thread created
- [ ] Switch to thread with no messages → divider shows 0 messages
- [ ] Switch to thread from long ago → time displays correctly
- [ ] Switch to thread with long last message → truncated to 80 chars
- [ ] Multiple rapid switches → dividers appear correctly
- [ ] Divider with HTML in last message → properly escaped

---

## 🎨 Design Rationale

### Why Double Line Dividers (━)?
- More visible than single lines
- Creates clear visual separation
- Looks professional in Telegram
- Works on all devices/themes

### Why Show Last Message?
- Helps user recall context immediately
- Reduces cognitive load
- Matches ChatGPT thread switching UX
- Organic conversation flow

### Why Time Display?
- Shows thread activity freshness
- Helps prioritize which threads to focus on
- Natural language format (not timestamps)

### Why Minimal Keyboard Update?
- Just sends "📋" emoji after divider
- Keeps focus on divider content
- Reduces message spam
- Cleaner visual flow

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
1. **Reply-to dividers**: Make divider reply to last message in thread
2. **Rich previews**: Show code blocks in preview
3. **Thread stats**: Add token count, model used
4. **Customizable format**: User preferences for divider style
5. **Divider history**: Option to hide/show recent dividers

### Phase 4 Integration
- Add workflow info to divider (active workflows in thread)
- Show task count in divider
- Link to /tasks from divider

---

## 📊 Performance

### Redis Operations per Divider
- 1 read: Get thread metadata
- 1 read: Get last 2 messages from history
- Total: 2 Redis ops (~5-10ms)

### Telegram API Calls per Divider
- 1 send_message: Divider
- 1 send_message: Keyboard update (optional)
- Total: 1-2 API calls (~100-200ms)

**Overall Impact:** Negligible (~200ms per switch)

---

## ✅ Summary

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete  
**Lines Added:** ~237 lines  
**Integration Points:** 3 (thread selection, new thread, lazy creation)  
**User Experience:** Organic, context-aware, Telegram-native

**Ready for:** Testing and user feedback
