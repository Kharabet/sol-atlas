## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| WebSocket scaling issues | High | Test with load testing, implement connection pooling |
| Telegram auth changes | Medium | Monitor Telegram docs, implement fallback |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | Profile early, optimize hot paths |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular audits, penetration testing |
