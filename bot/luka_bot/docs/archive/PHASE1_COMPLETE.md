## 🚀 How to Test

```bash
# 1. Start services
redis-server
# Camunda at localhost:8080
ollama serve

# 2. Run luka_bot
python -m luka_bot

# 3. Test in Telegram
/start          # Creates thread, shows keyboard
Hello!          # Streams LLM reply
/chats          # Opens inline thread list
[Tap thread]    # Switches with divider
➕ New Thread   # Creates from keyboard
🔄 Refresh      # Updates keyboard
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### First Time User
```
1. User: /start
   Bot: 👋 Welcome! [Streams personalized message]
   Bot: 📚 Your threads: [Shows reply keyboard]

2. User: Hello!
   Bot: [Streams LLM reply with context]

3. User: [Taps "➕ New Thread"]
   Bot: ✨ New thread created!
   Bot: 📚 Threads updated: [Updated keyboard]

4. User: [Taps thread name]
   Bot: 🔀 Switched to: My Thread
   Bot: [Context now in that thread]
```

### Reply Keyboard Layout

## 🔍 What's Different from bot_server?

### New in luka_bot
1. **Reply keyboard with threads** - Always visible, easy switching
2. **Cleaner architecture** - Separate package, clear imports
3. **Phase-based structure** - Ready for incremental expansion
4. **Enhanced logging** - Emoji indicators for better readability
5. **Thread switching helper** - Centralized logic with divider support

### Reused from bot_server
- All core services (streaming, context, sessions, etc.)
- Camunda integration
- Redis caching
- Prometheus metrics
- Agent infrastructure

---

## 📝 Remaining Phase 1

### Only 1 Task Left
- [ ] **E2E Testing** - Automated test suite
  - Manual testing works perfectly ✅
  - Need to write pytest cases
  - Estimate: 2-3 hours

### Why Not Done Yet?
- Core functionality is complete and working
- Manual testing validates all flows
- Automated tests are for CI/CD safety net
- Can proceed to Phase 2 while writing tests

---

## 🔜 Phase 2 Preview

### Thread Control Messages
- Render thread info (Model, Name, KBs, Tools, Stats)
- Inline controls (rename, change model, add KB, clear context)
- Delete control message on switch
- MCPs placeholder

### Files to Create
- `handlers/thread_info.py` - Renderer
- `handlers/thread_controls.py` - Control callbacks

### BPMN Work
- Extend `chatbot_thread.bpmn` with `control_` tasks
- Init stage emits control tasks
- Task IDs: `control_set_model`, `control_add_kb`, etc.

### Estimate
- Phase 2: 3-4 hours
- ~300 lines of new code

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Service reuse** - 100% of bot_server services reused successfully
2. **Phased approach** - MVP scope kept implementation focused
3. **Reply keyboard** - Game-changer for UX (not in original bot_server)
4. **Clean separation** - New package allows independent evolution

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Service locator pattern** - Avoided circular dependencies
2. **Thread switching** - Unified logic with helper function
3. **Keyboard state** - Pagination and current thread tracking
4. **Context resolution** - Seamless auto-thread creation

### Best Practices Applied
1. ✅ Reuse validated modules
2. ✅ Log extensively with emoji indicators
3. ✅ Handle errors gracefully
4. ✅ Document as you build
5. ✅ Phase deliverables, not big bang

---
