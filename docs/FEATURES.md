## 🤖 AI CoPilot Steward

### Overview
Intelligent AI assistant that guides members through onboarding, quests, and community navigation.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Onboarding Assistant
```
User: /start
CoPilot: Hey there! 👋 Welcome to [Community Name].

I'm your Atlas CoPilot, here to help you get started.

Would you like to:
🎯 Start your first quest
💎 Learn about our project
🏆 See the leaderboard
🔗 Connect your wallet
```

#### 2. Natural Language Q&A
```
User: How do I earn points?
CoPilot: Great question! There are several ways:

1. Complete quests (/quests to see available)
2. Refer friends (you get 50 points per referral)
3. Participate in discussions (quality messages earn points)
4. Trade using our protocol (on-chain activity rewards)

Ready to start? I recommend the "Welcome Quest" — it's quick and gives you 100 points!
```

#### 3. Contextual Guidance
```
# CoPilot detects user behavior
if user.viewed_quest && !user.started_quest:
  copilot.suggest("I see you're checking out quests! Want help getting started?")

if user.wallet_not_connected && viewing_onchain_quest:
  copilot.prompt("This quest requires a connected wallet. Would you like me to walk you through connecting one?")
```

#### 4. Knowledge Base Integration
```yaml
copilot_knowledge:
  sources:
    - project_documentation
    - faq
    - community_guidelines
    - solana_basics
    - defi_concepts

  update_frequency: "real_time"
  citation: true # Always shows sources

  custom_responses:
    - trigger: "tokenomics"
      response: "Our token has..."
    - trigger: "roadmap"
      response: "Here's what's coming..."
