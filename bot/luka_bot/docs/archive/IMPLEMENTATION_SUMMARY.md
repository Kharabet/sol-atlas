## 🔄 Design Changes from Original PRD

### 1. Lazy Thread Creation (NEW ✨)
**Original:** Immediate thread creation on `/start`  
**Current:** ChatGPT-style lazy creation

**Why:** Better UX, matches user expectations

**How it works:**
1. User hits `/start` → sees random prompt
2. User types first message → thread created
3. Thread name generated from message via LLM
4. FSM states manage creation flow
5. Redis locks prevent race conditions

### 2. Reply Keyboard for Threads (NEW ✨)
**Original:** Thread management only via `/chats` command  
**Current:** Always-visible reply keyboard

**Why:** More accessible, better mobile UX

**Features:**
- Thread list always visible
- Quick switching without commands
- Edit/delete buttons per row
- "➕ New Thread" button
- Empty state for new users

### 3. HTML Markup (NEW ✨)
**Original:** Plain text responses  
**Current:** Rich HTML formatting

**Why:** Better readability, richer UX

**Supports:**
- Bold, italic, code formatting
- Table handling (simplified)
- Proper character escaping
- Truncation with tag preservation

### 4. Simplified Thread Model (CHANGED ⚠️)
**Original:** Thread = Camunda process instance  
**Current:** Thread = Redis hash (Phase 3)

**Why:** Faster MVP, Camunda deferred to Phase 4

**Migration path:**
- `process_instance_id` field reserved
- Ready for Phase 4 Camunda integration

### 5. Active Thread Indicator (ENHANCED 💬)
**Original:** ▶️ play button  
**Current:** 💬 speech bubble

**Why:** More intuitive for chat context
