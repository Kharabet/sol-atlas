# Knowledge Base Tool Result Rendering Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Problem

When the LLM used the `search_knowledge_base` tool in group conversations, the formatted message snippets with deeplinks were not being displayed to users. Instead, the LLM would consume the tool results and reformat them in its own words, losing the structured format and clickable links.

### User Experience Before Fix
```
User: "What did we discuss about shakheds?"

LLM Response:
"We discussed shakheds in several messages. Evgeny mentioned them 
in the context of... [paraphrased content without links]"
```

### Expected Behavior
```
User: "What did we discuss about shakheds?"

LLM Response:
"We discussed shakheds in several messages. Here's what I found:"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📚 Found 5 relevant messages:

1. 👤 Evgeny • 👥 Group • 2025-10-11 20:39
   🔗 View in group
   💬 "Discussing the topic of shakheds..."

2. 🤖 GURU Keeper • 👥 Group • 2025-10-11 21:09
   🔗 View in group
   💬 "Shakheds are martyrs who died..."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Root Cause

The tool's formatted output was being passed to the LLM context, but not explicitly yielded to the user. The LLM would process the structured snippets and generate its own narrative, discarding the carefully formatted message cards and deeplinks.

## Solution

Modified `llm_service.py` `stream_response()` to:

1. **Detect KB Tool Usage**: After streaming completes, scan all messages to identify if `search_knowledge_base` was called
2. **Extract Tool Results**: Find the `ToolReturnPart` containing the formatted snippets (identified by the `━━━━━━` separator)
3. **Append After LLM Response**: Yield the formatted snippets as a continuation of the LLM's narrative

### Implementation Details

```python
# In llm_service.py, stream_response()

# After streaming completes...

# 1. Detect KB tool call
for msg in all_msgs:
    if msg.kind == 'response':
        for part in msg.parts:
            if part.__class__.__name__ == 'ToolCallPart':
                if 'search_knowledge_base' in part.tool_name:
                    kb_tool_called = True

# 2. Extract formatted results
if kb_tool_called:
    for msg in all_msgs:
        if msg.kind == 'request':
            for part in msg.parts:
                if part.__class__.__name__ == 'ToolReturnPart':
                    result = str(part.content) or str(part.tool_return)
                    if '━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━' in result:
                        kb_tool_results.append(result)

# 3. Append to response
if kb_tool_results and full_response:
    yield '\n\n'
    for kb_result in kb_tool_results:
        yield kb_result  # Formatted message cards with deeplinks
```

## Key Features

1. **Non-Intrusive**: Only activates when KB search tool is used
2. **Preserves LLM Context**: LLM still receives and processes tool results for narrative generation
3. **User-Friendly Output**: Structured message cards with deeplinks are displayed after the LLM's summary
4. **Fallback Support**: If LLM generates no text, tool results are shown directly

## User Experience After Fix

Users now see:
- **LLM's Narrative Summary**: Contextual explanation of what was found
- **Formatted Message Snippets**: Structured cards with:
  - Sender name and role (👤 User / 🤖 Bot)
  - Source (👥 Group / 👤 DM)
  - Timestamp
  - Truncated message preview
  - **Clickable deeplink** to view original message in Telegram

## Testing

Test the feature by:

1. **In a group chat**, send several messages on a topic
2. **Mention the bot** with a search query: `@GuruKeeperBot what did we discuss about [topic]?`
3. **Verify** the response shows:
   - LLM's summary at the top
   - Formatted message cards below with working deeplinks

## Files Modified

- `/Users/evgenyvakhteev/Documents/src/dexguru/bot/luka_bot/services/llm_service.py`
  - Enhanced `stream_response()` to detect KB tool usage
  - Added logic to extract and append formatted tool results

## Related Documentation

- `KB_TOOL_ENHANCED_SEARCH.md` - Enhanced KB search with AI summary and deeplinks
- `KB_SEARCH_FORMATTING_UPDATE.md` - Original formatting enhancement for KB tool

## Impact

- ✅ Users can now click deeplinks to view original messages in context
- ✅ Search results are structured and easy to scan
- ✅ LLM narrative provides helpful context before showing sources
- ✅ No loss of functionality - all existing features preserved

---

**Note**: This fix completes the KB search enhancement by ensuring the formatted output is always displayed to users, not just consumed by the LLM internally.
